# OnlineShop-NodeJS
---

#### Quick start

Clone the repo:

```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/Kleimionov-WebRuby/OnlineShop-NodeJS.git
```

Or [Download the latest release.](https://github.com/Kleimionov-WebRuby/OnlineShop-NodeJS/archive/master.zip)

#### Installation

Application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd OnlineShop-NodeJS
$ npm install -d
$ node index
```

#### Nodemon

For convenience, I recommend that you install Nodemon

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development. Install it using npm.

```sh
 $ npm install -g nodemon
```

Use the command below to verify that the installation was successful

```sh
 $ nodemon -v
```

Just use nodemon instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes.

```sh
 $ nodemon index
```
